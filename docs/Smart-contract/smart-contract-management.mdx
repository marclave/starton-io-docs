The Smart contract management is an abstraction on top of our [Transaction Manager](/docs/services/transaction-manager) and it allow you to build and **automate** your smart contract transaction easily, without struggling with the [ABI](/docs/soon) and params encoding. With it you can:
- [Deploying smart contract](/docs/services/smart-contract-management/deploy): Deploy audited contract from our library or your own smart contract
- [Import existing contract](/docs/services/smart-contract-management/import): Import existing contract to view them on your dashboard and interact with them.
- [Interact](/docs/services/smart-contract-management/interact): Read state and interact with the smart contract previously deployed or imported
