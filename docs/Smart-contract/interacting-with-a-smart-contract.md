# Interacting with a Smart Contract

Once a smart contract has been deployed or imported, you can interact with it using our **Dashboard** or from Code using the Relayer.

The possible interactions are:
- Calling a function of the smart contract (will require gas on the associated blockchain's network).
- Reading the information on the smart contract (usually free of gas), such as reading the balance on an ERC20 contract.

## From Dashboard

1. In **Smart Contract**, select a **Smart Contract**.
1. Select a **function**.
1. Enter the **parameters**.
1. Click **Run**.

## From Code

Learn [how to interact with a Smart Contract from Code](/Tutorials/interact-from-code.md) in our Tutorial section.
