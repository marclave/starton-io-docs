# Onboarding on Starton

By creating a free account on Starton, you can deploy and interact with your Smart contract and watch your transactions.

## Creating an free account

1. Go to [Starton.io](https://app.starton.io/).
1. Click **Continue with email**.
1. Enter your information.
1. Click **Sign up**.

## Setting up your API key

You will be authenticated by Starton's API. For today, let's use a test API key.

1. From the **Menu**, click **Developer**.
1. Click **+ API key**.
1. Select **Test API key**.
1. Enter your key information.
1. Click **Next**.

### Using API keys in your application
To use **Starton** from your application, you will need to authenticate. 

To do so, you need to add your API key in the header of your request: 

1. Go to the **Developer** section.
1. Copy your API key.
1. Add your API key in the header of your requests, as such:

```jsx
const http = axios.create({
    baseURL: "https://api.starton.io/v3",
    headers: {
        "x-api-key": 'YOUR_API_KEY', //API KEY COPIED FROM STARTON
    },
})
```

:::caution

Note that your API key should be SECRET. With it, anyone could call the Starton API on your behalf.

:::

For more information on API Keys, read [Using Starton API](/Developer/API.md).


## Setting up a wallet on Starton

When deploying and interacting with **Smart Contracts** on testnet, you can create a wallet on Starton KMS to sign transactions.

1. From **Dashboard**, go to **Wallet**.
1. Click **Add a wallet**.
1. Enter a **Name** and a **Description** for your wallet.

You can now use your wallet.

You can also import your own KMS at any time and change ownership of your Smart contract. Read more in [Tutorials](/Tutorials/how-to-change-the-smart-contracts-ownership.md).
