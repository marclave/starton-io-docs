The Transaction Manager is the heart of Starton regarding pre-chain management. It allows you to send a large number of transactions with peace of mind and handles all the complexity, assuring that your transactions will be on-chain as soon as possible. But the blockchain is complex and sometimes you can encounter problems such as:

- Lost transaction
- Nonce issue
- Gas price management
- Automatic signature
- Real-time status of your transaction

The Transaction Manager role is to handle these errors when possible and otherwise to inform users of the transaction status so they can take action.
