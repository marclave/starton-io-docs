# Deploying your first Smart contract

You can use Starton to turn your application into a dApp in a few steps.

Let's create a project to deploy a smart contract from Code with Starton's API. To deploy a smart contract from Dashboard, see [Deploying a smart contract](/Smart-contract/deploying-a-smart-contract.mdx).

**Starton** provides you with a library of smart contracts templates.
To start let's create your own token.

:::note You will need:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [Starton wallet](https://starton.io/)
-   [Starton API Key](https://starton.io/)
-   An address to fund your smart contract transaction 
:::

## Creating an Application project

1. Create a directory for your app.
1. Create a directory named `src`.
1. In your terminal, install the express package using
   `npm i express`
1. In `src`, create a `index.js` file.
1. In `index.js`, enter the following lines to set up a port for your project:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const express = require("express")
const routes = require("./routes")
const app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json())
const port = 3001 // Port of the project

app.set("port", port) // Set the port of the project
app.use("/", routes)
app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

This will deploy your app on port `3001`.

Now for the good part, let's connect Starton to your application.

## Connecting Starton to your application

1. In src, create a `routes.js` file.

    ```jsx showLineNumbers
    const express = require("express")
    const axios = require("axios")
    const router = express.Router()
    ```

1. In it, first authenticate with your API KEY.

    ```jsx showLineNumbers
    // AUTHENTICATING TO THE API USING YOUR API KEY
    const startonApi = axios.create({
    	baseURL: "https://api.starton.io",
    	headers: {
    		"x-api-key": "YOUR API KEY ",
    	},
    })
   ```

## Deploying your first Smart contract

To create a smart contract from the code of your application, use the following snippet.
You can find the full list of endpoints in our <a href="https://docs.starton.io/intro#tag/SmartContract">API reference</a>.
Find more information about smart contracts parameters in the [smart contract references section](/Smart-contract/parameters-and-functions.mdx).

```jsx showLineNumbers
 // DEPLOYING YOUR SMART CONTRACT
axiosInstance
	.post("/v3/smart-contract/from-template", {
		network: "binance-testnet",
		signerWallet: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
		templateId: "ERC20_META_TRANSACTION",
		name: "My first smart token",
		description: "This is the first smart contract I deploy. ",
		params: ["My first token ", "MFT", "1000000000", "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"],
		speed: "average",
	})
	.then((response) => {
		console.log(response.data)
	})
```

1. Display a message on your `localhost:3001` to inform you that the transaction is successful.

    ```jsx showLineNumbers
    router.get("/", (req, res) => {
    	res.send("Upload successful")
    })

    module.exports = router
    ```
   
## Starting your application

1. In your terminal, run `node src`.

You deployed your first smart contract with Starton. Congratulations!

Now that you've created your app, you can interact with your smart contract. 

<div class="row-is-multiline">

<div class="col col--2" class="cards">
	<a class="button-card button-card--vertical" href="https://app.starton.io/projects">
		<h3>Check your smart contract on the Dashboard</h3>
		<div class="button-card__inner">
			<p color="white">Go to <b>Starton Dashboard</b> and check all the transactions of your smart contracts at one glance.</p>

	</a>

## Interacting with your first Smart contract

To check that everything went your way, you can see the activity of your Smart contract.

You can interact with the smart contract we just created.
To start, we will call a simple function to put our contract in a pause state.

To get notified of the transactions of your smart contracts, you can also [create a watcher](/Tutorials/monitoring-blockchain-activity.mdx).

To interact with your smart contract from the code of your application, use the following snippet.
You can find the full list of endpoints in our <a href="https://docs.starton.io/intro#tag/SmartContract">API reference</a>.

```jsx showLineNumbers
const axios = require("axios")

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.io",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "PUT HERE YOUR API KEY",
	},
})

axiosInstance
	.post("/v3/smart-contract/binance-testnet/0x6Ea6e02a3C3dA7C690f1169C4e3e11a413875307/call", {
		functionName: "pause",
		params: [],
		signerWallet: "0x5CCa311b2DFe4EDeA94a4aF086cA9954d3c06d23",
		speed: "average",
	})
	.then((response) => {
		console.log(response.data)
	})
```
