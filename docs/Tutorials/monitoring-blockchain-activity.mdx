# Monitoring blockchain activity

With **Starton**, you can monitor blockchain activity. Whether it's to watch the activity of a wallet or a smart contract, you can create watchers, triggered by events.

An event is a set of conditions that are checked when a block is inspected.

When the conditions of a watcher are met, the watcher triggers and sends a communication to the webhook given during the watcher's creation.

## Creating a watcher 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="code" label="From Code">
To create a watcher from the code of your application, use the following snippet.
You can find the full list of networks and event types in our <a href="https://docs.starton.io/intro#tag/Watcher/operation/WatcherCreateOne">API reference</a>.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" showLineNumbers>
{`const axios = require("axios");
// First, authenticate to the API
const startonApi = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://api.starton.io",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});
// Use the watcher creation endpoint
startonApi.post(
    "/v3/watcher",
    {
        name: "Name of your watcher", // Enter a name for your watcher
        description: "Describe your watcher", // Enter a description for your watcher
        address: "0x000000000000", // Enter the address to watch (either a wallet or a smart contract)
        network: "polygon-mumbai",// Enter a network, you can find the list of networks available in our API reference.
        type: "ADDRESS_ACTIVITY",// Select an event type
        webhookUrl: "https://xxxxxxx/", // Enter the address of the webhook
        confirmationsBlocks: 50 // Depending on your needs, select the number of confirmed blocks before an event triggers your watcher
    }
).then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data)
})`}
